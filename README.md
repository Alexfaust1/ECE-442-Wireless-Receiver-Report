# ECE-442-Wireless-Receiver-Report
The design for the architecture my team implemented is given here. We were required to meet specs such as:
  1. Minimum SNR at the output
  2. Maximum Noise figure
  3. Maximum Outpute spurious
  4. Maximum Phase Error

Real world-parts were source, but the system was not physically built. We essentially designed the receiver
as if it were and actual design. One could very well purchase the parts listed and build it.
